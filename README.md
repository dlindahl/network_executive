# Network Executive

An experimental application used to drive displays hung around an office.

# Ideas

* _Network_ - An server instance with a specific channel line-up. Think Tech vs. Sales vs. Marketing
* _Channel Line-up_ - A JSON/YML file that defines URLs and display times
* _EAS_ - Allow a channel to break into the schedule to display important content
* _Ticker_ - Allow a separate feed of info. Tweets, metrics, WOWs, etc.
* _Network Logo_ - Useful?
* _Commericals / PSAs_ - The More You Know?
* _Viewer_ - The client-side component. SSEs?
* _Clicker_ - Client-side slide out remote to change channels/networks?
